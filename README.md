# Dotfiles üêß

Mostly a note to self, in case I hit my head someday.

## Installation & Usage

This dotfiles repo is managed using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
In order to get started with using my configs for the software listed below, you can simply:
  * Clone this repo *into your home directory*
  * From within the cloned repo, run:
    + `stow calcurse` for setting up the symlinks for calcurse. Replace as necessary.
    + `stow *` for setting up all the symlinks.
  * Profit!
